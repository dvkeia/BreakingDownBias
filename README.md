## Inspiration
We wanted to try something new at the hackathon that pushed us outside our comfort zone. When we saw Taipy, we thought it would be a perfect way to learn something new and refresh our skills in python. For the project, we decided to use a data set on gender bias throughout the world to create data visualizations to help people understand biases against women. Breaking Down Bias offers a exploration of bias through data visualization to empower users to understand and address societal inequalities and biases.

## What it does
Breaking Down Bias has three main features (Country Comparator, World View, and World Map) for the user to interact with and our home screen, which explains the importance of the topic and a quick break down of the categories studied. 
With the Country Comparator feature, users can compare the impact of bias between two different nations, gaining insights into the unique challenges each country faces. Breaking Down Bias sheds light on the disparities affecting communities worldwide.
Delve deeper with the World View feature, where we dissect the four dimensions of bias (political, physical, educational, and economic) and illustrate how each gender perceives them. Through interactive charts and analysis, users gain a comprehensive understanding of the nuanced layers of societal prejudice and how even women themselves can hold these biases.
Navigate the landscape of bias with ease using the World Map function, allowing users to filter and visualize bias percentages across the globe. The filter feature enable us to observe closely the percentages of bias, whether it no bias, at least one bias in the dimension, or specific dimension bias. 

## How we built it
We built Breaking Down Bias with Taipy and Python, leveraging pandas for seamless data management and Taipy for easy to create dashboards with data visualization. We transformed the Excel sheets from 2023 Gender Social Norms Index Report into CSV files, reforming the sheets to only include the tables of data without any merged cells or unnecessary cells to make it easy to read through pandas. We used markdown to format the pages and display the graphs and information.
